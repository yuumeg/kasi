I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes
Don't wanna fall asleep
'Coz I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Coz even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Laying close to you
Feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes
And thank God we're together
I just want to stay with you in this moment forever
Forever and ever

Don't wanna close my eyes
Don't wanna fall asleep
'Coz I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Coz even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
I just wanna be with you
Right here with you just like this
I just wanna hold you close
Feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment for all the rest of time,
Baby baby

Don't wanna close my eyes
Don't wanna fall asleep
'Coz I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Coz even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Don't wanna close my eyes
Don't wanna fall asleep
'Coz I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Coz even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
